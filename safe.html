<h2>Who is SmartAtHome.co.uk?</h2>
SmartAtHome.co.uk is just a hobby site ran by me, Mark. I'm nice, I promise. You can email me at mark<code>@</code>smartathome.co.uk.
<h2>Is it safe to give you my account number and API key?</h2>
I only use your account number and API key to get your electricity usage from Octopus. You don't have to put them in, but without them, I can't get your usage. They are passed directly to Octopus, not stored or logged on my server.
<h2>Is your website secure?</h2>
Yes, the whole site is served over https, you should see a little padlock symbol in your address bar.
<h2>What happens if I click 'Keep me logged in'?</h2>
I store a small file, called a cookie, on your computer, with your account number and API key in. I still do not log or store your details.
<h2>How do I know you don't do anything else with them?</h2>
The code for this website is open sourced on <a href='https://github.com/ndg63276/octopus'>GitHub</a>, so anyone can check what I'm doing any time.
<h2>I'm not with Octopus Energy.</h2>
I highly recommend them, they're excellent. And they're not paying me to say that (although I do get referral fees). They are especially good for people with electric cars, or people willing to move their electricity usage to outside the 4-7pm window. You can join them and get &pound;50 credit by clicking <a href="https://share.octopus.energy/tidy-jay-1000">here</a>.
